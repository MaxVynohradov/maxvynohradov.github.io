The concept first appeared in the context of software in the book Object-Oriented Software Engineering (by Ivar Jacobson, Patrik Jonsson, ACM Press Staff, Magnus Christerson, Gunnar Overgaard). In general, think of entropy as a measure of the dishonesty of the system. The more disorder, uncertainty, the higher the probability of breakage. Compare a hammer and a car, which is a hundred times more complex in its structure - which one is broken down more often and faster?
